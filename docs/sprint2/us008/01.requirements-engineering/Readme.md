## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Fleet Manager, I want to list the vehicles needing the check-up.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> The Vehicle and Equipment Fleet Manager manages the machines, equipment, and vehicles, ensuring their good condition.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What are the requests/ input data to list the vehicles needing the check-up? Type of vehicle, Current Km and Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in Kms) are sufficient?
>
> **Answer:** Current Km and Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in Kms) are sufficient, yes.

> **Question:** Are there acceptance criteria when asking for the list?
>
> **Answer:** The list must contain all vehicles that have already exceeded the number of km required for the inspection or those that are close to it.
>The list must clearly identify the vehicles through: plate number, brand, model and the that justified the checkup need.

>  **Question:** "The list must clearly identify the vehicles through: plate number, brand, model and the [?] that justified the checkup need."
Did you mean the reason for the check-up need?
>
> **Answer:** [?] DATA
current kms, frequency, last checkup kms, next checkup (optimal) kms

> **Question:** Can the vehicles get placed automatically on a list or the one listing has to be the FM?

> **Question:** I'm not sure if I understood everything about US08. In this US we should only list the vehicles that need a check up (surpass the check up frequency in KM) or that will shortly need a check up (5% to the check up frequency *already said in another post*), correct? If so, the information about the checkup frequency for each vehicle should be asked in US07?
>
> **Answer:** No; the Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in km) is registered in US06.
