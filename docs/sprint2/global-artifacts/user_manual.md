# Introduction
## Purpose and Scope

<p style="text-align: justify">
As part of the Integrating Project (IP), namely in the discipline of Laboratory / 
Project II (LAPR2), the purpose of this document is to gather relevant information 
for the user manual, intended firstly for the collective use of the MusgoSublime 
organisation and finally for users of the urban green spaces. <br>
This user manual describes an urban green space management application 
for the MusgoSublime organisation, additionally with a section that collects feedback from 
users of the urban green spaces managed by this organisation. In this manual, the 
user can find information related to some business transactions (functionalities), 
which are aimed at MusgoSublime members. Subsequently, the user of the urban green 
space can find details on how the application works, namely how to send feedback on 
the urban green space they have used.
